For example data quality metrics should be recalculated with data (daily partitioned tables).\n\nPossible workarounds: 1) Put date of partition to Label/tag, put current timestamp to timestamp of metric. It requires external aggregation (first value for a label) so forces to use Bar Gauge panel in grafana. It’s not a time-series data/plot then. 2) Put the same data structure to promscale. Use sql to transform the data (window function with first + cast label to timestamp). Needs extra db only for sql access. 3) Put something between vm and grafana panel that can transform json. Rest service or grafana plugin.\n\nDoes anybody know simple solution?",

    "VictoriaMetrics processes matching time series one-by-one per each available cpu core.

    "Hi! VictoriaMetrics implements replication on application level. It means, only \"writers\" (vminserts) and \"readers\" (vmselect) are aware of it. \"vmstorage\" nodes just store everything they receive, and return everything they asked for. \nOn the one hand, such approach is very easy to understand and predict. It also significantly improves performance and maintainability of the cluster.\nOn the other hand, vmstorage nodes are not aware of the replication.
