# Conversation Insights

#### A full-stack web application built in 4 weeks as Hackbright Fellowship final project.

## Description

The Conversation Insights is an initiative aimed at gathering insights and understanding trends from data collected
within the Telegram messaging platform. The project may involve the use of data analytics tools and techniques to
process and analyze large volumes of data, with the goal of identifying patterns, trends, and other useful information
that can inform decision-making or help improve the user experience on Telegram. Possible areas of analysis may include
user behavior, messaging frequency, demographics, and more. The insights gained from the project may be used to improve
the platform, develop new features, or inform marketing and advertising strategies.
